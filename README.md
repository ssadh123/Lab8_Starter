## Graceful Degradation & Service Workers
Graceful degradation is the practice of building a web application so that its core content and functionality remain usable on every browser, while advanced capabilities are layered on where they’re supported. Service workers put this idea into action: in modern browsers they intercept network requests, cache assets, and let the site work offline, giving users a fast, app‑like experience. Older browsers that lack service‑worker support simply bypass this layer and load the site over the network as usual, ensuring everyone can still access the recipes—even if they don’t get the offline perks.
